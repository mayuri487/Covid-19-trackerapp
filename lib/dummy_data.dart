    'question':
        'Can Coronavirus disease be caught from a person who has no symptoms?',
    'answer':
        'The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.'

    'question': 'Which are the first symptoms of the coronavirus disease?',
    'answer':
        'The virus can cause a range of symptoms, ranging from mild illness to pneumonia. Symptoms of the disease are fever, cough, sore throat and headaches. In severe cases difficulty in breathing and deaths can occur.'

  {
    'question': 'What are signs and symptoms of the coronavirus disease?',
